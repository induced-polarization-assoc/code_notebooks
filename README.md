# code_notebooks
Compilation of Jupyter Notebooks used for prototyping DSP algorithms for marine induced polarization data.

Usage: 

Some of these notebooks will not work if they used a now defunct AWS server for data storage.  However, they will hopefully illustrate to
a developer how the data has been approached and how it was structured from the previous iteration of the data logging software 
for marine induced polarization.
